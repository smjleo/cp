# goodbinary

### Problem Statement
Leo learned what binary numbers are in his Computer Science class today. Interested, he decided to play around with binary numbers in his spare time. However, he has encountered a problem. He hates the number 11, as it reminds him of chopsticks (his least fabourite cutlery). Subsequently, he absolutely detests the consecutive occurrence of 2 or more 1s.

He calls a binary number "good" if there are no consecutive appearances of the number 1. For example, 101001 is a good binary number, while 101101 is not. He wonders how many good binary numbers of length `n` exists. Help him find this number MOD 1000000009 (as it can get quite large).

### Input format
The input will be a single integer, `n`.

### Constraints
1 <= `n` <= 10^6

### Output format
Output a single integer, the number of good binary numbers of length `n` MOD 1000000009.

### Subtasks
- **Subtask 1**: `n` <= 10 (10 points)
- **Subtask 2**: `n` <= 1000 (30 points)
- **Subtask 3**: No additional constraints (60 points)


### Sample Input 1
```2```

### Sample Output 1
```1```

### Sample Input 2
```120```

### Sample Output 2
```773750983```
